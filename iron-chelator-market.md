<p><strong>The Iron Chelator Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transfusional Iron Overload</li><li>NTDT Caused Iron Overload</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The iron chelator market primarily addresses transfusion-related and non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia (NTDT) iron overload. In patients receiving multiple blood transfusions, excess iron accumulates, leading to severe complications. Iron chelators help remove this excess iron, improving patient outcomes and quality of life. Similarly, patients with NTDT can experience iron overload due to increased gastrointestinal absorption. Both treatment settings rely on effective iron chelation therapies to prevent long-term damage to organs, making the market essential for managing these conditions.</p></p>
