<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Beam Couplings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Beam Couplings</li><li>Multi Beam Couplings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The beam couplings market is primarily divided into two types: single beam couplings and multi-beam couplings. Single beam couplings consist of a single flexible beam that allows for angular misalignment, making them suitable for lightweight applications. In contrast, multi-beam couplings feature multiple flexible beams, providing enhanced torque transmission and greater misalignment tolerance. This makes multi-beam couplings ideal for more demanding applications in robotics, automation, and precision engineering, where robustness and flexibility are critical.</p></p>
